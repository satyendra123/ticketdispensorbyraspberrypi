# lets suppose i have a loop detector. when car comes to it then the sensor engaged and my ticket dispensor start working. so when a user comes and click on the button my printer will print a bar code which have the information about the ticket number, entry date and entry time. 
  and suppose some users have the monthly pass so in that case we provide him by a rfid card and he recharge the rfid on monthly basis. so when user tap the rfid on the ticket dispensor then the controller send the http request to the server with that rfid and fetch the information that how many days or balance left in his car and the barrier will open.
and in the exit side when the user will go by his qr code then in the system we have the barcode scanner and the printer. when the client will scan his qr code so based on the entry time and exit time his money will be calculated 
and stored in the database. and after payin the bill when user clicks on the print button printer prints the data and user will get this. as soon as the printer prints the barrier will open
